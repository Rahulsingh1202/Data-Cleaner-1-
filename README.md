# Data-Cleaner-1-
Detailed Description
Dataset Cleaner is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to solve one of the most time-consuming challenges in machine learning: preparing clean, high-quality image datasets for training. This professional-grade platform combines modern web technologies with advanced computer vision algorithms to deliver an automated, user-friendly solution for data preprocessing.

üéØ Problem It Solves
Machine learning engineers and data scientists often spend 70-80% of their time cleaning and preprocessing datasets. Manual dataset cleaning is tedious, error-prone, and doesn't scale well. Dataset Cleaner automates this process, allowing teams to focus on model development rather than data preparation.

üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router for a modern, responsive SPA

Backend: FastAPI with Python, featuring asynchronous processing, RESTful API design, and background task management

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow, and custom algorithms for duplicate detection and quality assessment

Real-time Features: Live progress tracking, job status monitoring, and instant feedback

‚ú® Core Features
Smart Cleaning Engine:

AI-powered duplicate detection using perceptual hashing
